        Each dictionary is in the following form,
        {
            "storm" : string # the storm ID from the NHC
            "metadata" : dict # the kml files used to create the results
            "entries" : array of dict # The data for the storm in the form,
                {
                    'time' : Datetime,
                    'wind' : Knots,
                    'lat' : Decimal Degrees,
